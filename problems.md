# Count something
- create a hash table and increment values as we encounter keys

# Process file
- if it doesn't fit into memory process it line by line in a streaming fashion

# Scalable hash table on disk (in terms of memory) (like for a problem to show the most popular words in a an unlimited stream of words)
- sql database with a table 'KEY,VALUE' where KEY is primary key (unique and indexed) (can be further optimized with in-memory cache of most popular items).
