[[concepts]]
Concepts
--------

* Underneath everything is a binary stream.
* Binary streams can be turned into other kinds of streams by the
mechanism of translation (filtering).
** character (text) stream - translates between bytes and characters by
consulting charset mappings.
** line stream - translates between text and lines by LF character.
** token stream (lexer) - translates between text and tokens by
consulting a lexical grammar.
** object stream (parser) - translates between tokens and objects by
consulting a syntax grammar.
* Input streams read (and translate) data from the source.
* Output streams (translate and) write data to the sink.
* Examples of IO streams are file streams, socket streams or byte array
streams.
* Object streams (iterators)
* Event streams
* Json parser event streams
* `stdio.h` - standard buffered input/output

[[standard-streams]]
Standard Streams
----------------

* Standard streams (STDIN, STDOUT, STDERR)
* https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Standard_streams[Standard Streams on
wikipedia]
* On linux:
** `/dev/stdin` -> `/proc/self/fd/0` -> character device
`/dev/pts/{number}`
** `/dev/stdout` -> `/proc/self/fd/1` -> character device
`/dev/pts/{number}`
** `/dev/stderr` -> `/proc/self/fd/2` -> character device
`/dev/pts/{number}`
* `man pts`

[[sream-buffering]]
Sream Buffering
---------------

* unbuffered
* line-buffered
* buffered

Unbuffered or line-buffered output should appear as soon as possible, to
ensure that prompting messages actually appear prior to a program
waiting for input.
