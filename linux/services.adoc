[[how-to-make-unix-service-see-environment-variables]]
How to make unix service see environment variables
--------------------------------------------------

The problem is service strips all environment variables but TERM, PATH
and LANG which is a good thing. If you are executing the script directly
nothing removes the environment variables so everything works.

You don't want to rely on external environment variables because at
startup the environment variable probably isn't present and your init
system probably won't set it anyway.

If you still want to rely on such variables, source a file and read the
variables from it, e.g. create /etc/default/servicename with the
content:

VAR=value and source it from your init script, e.g:

[source,bash]
----
[ -f /etc/default/service-name ] && . /etc/default/service-name

echo "$VAR"

The normal location for pidfiles is /var/run. Most unices will clean
this directory on boot; under Ubuntu this is achieved by /var/run an
in-memory filesystem (tmpfs).

If you start your daemon from a script that's running as root, have it
create a subdirectory /var/run/gmooredaemon and chown it to the
daemon-running user before suing to the user and starting the daemon.
