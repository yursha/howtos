* How signals work?
* gnu c lib `signal.h`
* some signals generate `core` files (core dumps) in the process CWD

Signal is a message sent by either operating system or some application
to your program (or one of its threads). Each signal identified by a
number, from 1 to 31. Signals donâ€™t carry any argument and their names
are mostly self explanatory. For instance SIGKILL or signal number 9
tells the program that someone tries to kill it. In addition to
informative nature of signals, they also interrupt your program. I.e to
handle a signal, one of the threads in your program, stops its execution
and temporarily switches to signal handler. Note that as in version 2.6
of Linux kernel, most of the signals interrupt only one thread and not
the entire application as it used to be once. Moreover, signal handler
itself can be interrupted by some other signal.

Inter-process synchronization may be achieved buy using files with
agreed upon names as locks. Acquiring a lock means assuring that such
file doens't exist and creating such a file in atomic operation (most OS
expose corresponding system calls). Releasing a lock means deleting such
a file.
