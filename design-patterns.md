## Canonical Model

## Canonical Object
Canonical object is an object that defines the baseline set of functionality for all objects (like `java.lang.Object`).

## Polymorphism
- Polymorphism only makes sense when the polymorphic behavior is really a behavior of the target. When it's the behavior of the observer, you need runtime typing.

## Design by contract
- https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Design_by_contract
If contracts are well designed, this is almost never an issue. Revist the contract and place obligations on the each of the parties. If a certain party has too many obligations then introduce a third party.

A contract (interface) between two parties say, A and B such that both have certain obligations. What does the contract say? Is B supposed to receive validated data? If that is the case, B should not be implementing validation. But what if A is the UI? Clearly you don't want to put the validation there. Typically, its best to introduce a third party, say C. A has a contract with C which in turn has a contract with B. B expects validated data. A might send crap. C performs the validation.

## Inheritance / Composition

## High Cohesion
- https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cohesion_(computer_science)

## Loose Coupling
- https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coupling_(computer_programming)

The more references the more coupling (problems). Coupling means that if one module changes it will necessitate changes in another module.

```bash
grep-ruby() { find app lib -iname '*.rb' | xargs grep $* }

grep-ruby -h '^[[:space:]]*\(class\|module\)\b' |
sed 's/^[[:space:]]*//' |
cut -d ' ' -f 2 |
while read class; do
    echo "$(grep-ruby -l "\b$class\b" | wc -l) $class"
done |
sort -n

# alternative form
grep -rh '^[[:space:]]*\(class\|module\)\b' app lib --include='*.rb' | sed 's/^[[:space:]]*//' | cut -d ' ' -f 2 | while read class; do echo "$(grep -rl "\b$class\b" app lib --include="*.rb" | wc -l) $class"; done | sort -n

# java form
find src/main -name '*.java' | xargs -n1 -I '{}' basename '{}' .java | while read class; do echo "$(grep -rl "\b$class\b" src --include="*.java" | wc -l) $class"; done | sort -rn
```
