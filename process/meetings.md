- [Parkinson's law of triviality](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Law_of_triviality) - members of an organisation give disproportionate weight to trivial issues (bike-shed effect)
- [Parkinson's law](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Parkinson%27s_law) - Work expands so as to fill the time available for its completion. Bureaucracies expand over time by two forces: (1) "An official wants to multiply subordinates, not rivals" and (2) "Officials make work for each other." The number employed in a bureaucracy rose by 5â€“7% per year "irrespective of any variation in the amount of work (if any) to be done".
