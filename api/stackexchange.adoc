Questions are asked on Stack Apps.

Applications should be registered on
https://stackapps.com/apps/oauth/register to get a request key. Request
keys grant more requests per day, and are necessary for using
`access_tokens` created via authentication.

All API responses are JSON, we do support JSONP with the `callback`
query parameter. Every response in the API is returned in a common
`wrapper` object, for easier and more consistent parsing.

Additionally, all API responses are compressed. The `Content-Encoding`
header is always set, but some proxies will strip this out. The proper
way to decode API responses can be found here.
