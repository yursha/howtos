Set up NVM and Node.js
----------------------

Use `nvm` to manage node versions and install node.js. Go to
https://github.com/creationix/nvm[NVM website] to find out the latest
command to download and install NVM as it changes over time.

Don't forget to `source ~/.bashrc`, once `nvm` is installed.

Check that installation was successful with `command -v nvm`. It should
output `nvm`.

Install node with:

....
nvm install node
nvm use node
....
