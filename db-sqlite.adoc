About SQLite
------------

The data for rowid tables is stored as a B-Tree structure containing one
entry for each table row, using the rowid value as the key. This means
that retrieving or sorting records by rowid is fast. Searching for a
record with a specific rowid, or for all records with rowids within a
specified range is around twice as fast as a similar search made by
specifying any other PRIMARY KEY or indexed value.

[[alter-table]]
`ALTER TABLE`
-------------

SQLite does not fully support `ALTER TABLE` statements.
The only thing you can do is rename a table and/or add columns.

To change a column data type do the following **inside a transaction**.

[source,sql]
....
CREATE TABLE tmp(field_a INT, field_b INT);

INSERT INTO tmp(field_a, field_b) SELECT field_a, field_b FROM original;

/* begin transaction */
DROP TABLE original
RENAME TABLE tmp TO original
/* end transaction */
....
