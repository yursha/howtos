## phases
- bytes are read and mapped to characters (trigraphs are replaced). (Trigraph translation)
- line continuations are searched and physical lines are spliced into logical lines. (Line joining)
- lines a parsed into a sequence of preprocessing tokens and comments. Each comment are replaces with a single space. (Translate comment to space)
- Preprocessing directives are executed (including recursively `#include` directive), macro invocations are expanded, and `_Pragma` unary operator expressions are executed. Preprocessing directives are then deleted.
- Source charset is translated into runtime charset.
- Adjacent string literal tokens are concatenated.


- source (preprocessing files) -> preprocessing translation unit -> translation unit -> object file
- object files -> linked program (or library). Translation units may be separately translated and then later linked to produce an executable program.

The separate translation units of a program communicate by:
- calls to functions whose identifiers have external linkage
- manipulation of objects whose identifiers have external linkage
- manipulation of data files.

# [javac](http://docs.oracle.com/javase/8/docs/technotes/tools/windows/javac.html)
- `javac -XD-printflat -d output_dir SomeFile.java` - look for javac does with `*.java` files

Javac compiles from Java source code into byte code. Each java class defined in `*.java` files gets compiled into its own `*.class` file.
Javac can also process annotations in Java source files and classes.
Javac accepts source files to compile either as a list of command-line parameters or in a file.

# java decompiler

- linking
- compiling
- dynamic loading
- share library

# Compiler optimizations

- tail call optimization

# Compiler phases
- preprocessor
- compiler
- linker

libraries can be shared (dynamic) and static

# Compiler Phases
- Syntactic Aspects (SMALL)
    + Lexical Analysis (understanding tokens)
    + Parsing (Parse Tree)
- Limited Semantic Analysis (MEDIUM) (types, scope rules) Try to understand the meaning and catch inconsistencies.
    + lexical scoping
    + variable bindings
    + type match
- Optimization (LARGE)
- Code Generation (SMALL)
