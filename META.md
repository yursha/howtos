# Tips
- compile your tools from source with static linking (otherwise the version of you tool or its dependency which you need may be unavailable on a target system)

# Stackoverflow tags
- http://stackoverflow.com/tags/java/info

# What's important
- Math, C.Sc, algorithms & data structures (and their time and space complexity)
- Hardware (RAM, CPU/ISA, Disk, NICs, sensors, DCP, etc.)
- Linux, c/c++, stdlibs, boost.io
- Networking (NICs, IP, TCP, UDP, TOPOLOGIES)
- Filesystems, databases (including distributed, etc. Cassandra)
- Cloud (Google Cloud, AWS, IAAS, PAAS)
- Distributed computation (Hadoop, MapReduce, Spark)
- Machine learning, argifical intellegence, neural networks, NLP
- Design patterns
- maybe JVM (java)
- maybe web (html, css, javascript, HTTP)
- maybe mobile
