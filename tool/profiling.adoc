Measure memory
++++++++++++++

[source,java]
----
Runtime runtime = Runtime.getRuntime();
// Run the garbage collector
runtime.gc();
// Calculate the used memory
long memory = runtime.totalMemory() - runtime.freeMemory();
System.out.println("Used memory is megabytes: " + memory / 1024 / 1024);

[[random-pause-technique]]
Random-Pause Technique
----------------------

* Take 10-20 execution stack snapshots
* Function overall time usage is the fraction of samples containing it.
* Function CPU usage is the fraction of those samples that don't
terminate in I/O or a system call.
* Function "self time" is the fraction of samples in which it itself is
the terminus.

[[measure-elapsed-time]]
Measure elapsed time
--------------------

* get current timestamp
* do some computation
* get current timestamp and compare
