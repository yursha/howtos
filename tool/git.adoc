[[compare-the-fetched-commits-with-local-branch]]
Compare the fetched commits with local branch
---------------------------------------------

* `git log master..origin/master --format="%Cred%><(12)%ar %Cblue%h%Creset %s" --color`

[[concepts]]
Concepts
--------

* distributed (Git, Mercurial, Bazaar, Darcs) and centralized (CVS,
Subversion, Perforce) VCS differ in where all the deltas and associated
metadata are stored.
* difference-based (CVS, Subversion, Perforce, Bazaar) vs snapshot-based
(Git)
* branch
** long-running vs topic
* tag
* conflict resolution mechanism
* textual conflict (can be handled by VCS) vs distributed conflict
(can't be handled by VCS)
* detached HEAD

In git commits, trees and blobs are stored under the name equal to their
hash values.

GitHub uses https and ssh protocols for remote communication.

[[how-to-commit]]
How to commit
-------------

Begin the commit message with a single short (less than 50 character)
line summarizing the change, followed by a blank line and then a more
thorough description.

* `git help gitremote-helpers`
* `git format-patch` - format commit into an email
* `git send-email`
* `git request-pull`

Commit - type and size - hash key of tree representing root directory -
author - committer - parent - comment - description

A tree is a blob which represents directory state - type and size - list
of hash keys of trees and blobs that this directory contains

A blob - type and size - file contents

* commit ammending
* patch - file format representing difference between files
* checkout - decompressed snapshot in the working directory
* tracked files - files that are in the last snapshot
* remote (`https://`, `git://`, `user@server:path/to/repo.git` (ssh))
* three-way merging
* Staging Area (index) - a special file in `.git` - staged files (place
where a new snapshot is being formed).
* `.git` repository - committed files (compressed metadata and object
database). Git generally only adds data here. Everything in Git is
check-summed before it is stored and is then referred to by that
checksum for the purposed of **integrity**. You can’t lose information
in transit or get file corruption without Git being able to detect it.
The mechanism that Git uses for this checksumming is called a SHA-1
hash. This is a 40-character string composed of hexadecimal characters
(0–9 and a–f) and calculated based on the contents of a file or
directory structure in Git. Git stores everything in its database not by
file name but by the hash value of its contents. In addition to the
commit SHA-1 checksum, Git also calculates a checksum that is based on
the patch introduced with the commit. This is called a “patch-id”.
* `hooks/`
* `info/`
** `alternates/`
* `logs/`
* `objects/` - the object database (files, dirs, commits, annotated
tags)
** `00/`, `01/`, ..., `ff/`
** `info/`
** `pack/`
*** `pack-hash.idx`
*** `pack-hash.pack`
* `refs/`
** `remotes/`
*** `origin`
**** `HEAD` -> `refs/remotes/origin/master`
**** dev -> commit hash
**** master -> commit hash
*** `john_doe`
**** head-name-1 -> commit hash
** `heads/`
*** `dev` -> commit hash
*** `master` -> commit hash
*** `feature1` -> commit hash
** `stash`
** `tags/`
*** `0.0.1` -> tag object hash for annotated tags (Tag object is a
binary blob)
*** `0.0.2` -> commit object hash for simple tags (Commit object is a
binary blob)
* `config` - repository configuration file
* `COMMIT_EDITMSG`
* `TAG_EDITMSG`
* `FETCH_HEAD` - hashes of all branches heads for fetching (txt file)
* `HEAD` -> `refs/heads/dev` (currently checkout branch)
* `ORIG_HEAD`
* `description`
* `packed-refs`
* `index` - cache of the state of a dir tree, used to create commits,
check out working dirs, and hold the various trees involved in a merge.

Commands
--------

* `git help <verb>`
* `git <verb> --help`
* `man git-<verb>`
* `git-format-patch`
* `git-am`
* `git-bisect` - When there is a regression in your project, one way to
track down the bug is by searching through the history to find the exact
commit that's to blame. Git bisect can help you perform a binary search
for that commit.
* `git gc`
* `git repack`
* `git pack-objects`
* `git submodule`
* `git init` - create new `.git` folder with skeleton contents
* `git push` - upload `.git` folder.
* `git push remote refs/heads/localhead:refs/heads/remotehead
* `git push [remote-name] [local-head]` - send new snapshots upstream
* `git push [remote-name] [local-head]:[remote-head]
* `git push [remote-name] :[remote-head] - delete remote branch
* `git push [remote-name] --delete [remote-head] - delete remote branch
* `git push --force`
* `git pull` - download `.git` folder
* `git pull` - fetch and merge a tracked remote branch into a local
branch
* `git pull --rebase`
* `git rm --cached -r` - ???
* `git rm --cached <pattern>` - remove files from git but keep it on
disk
* `git rm <pattern>` - remove files from git and disk
* `git add <pattern>` - copy any new/changed file, directory, matches or
everything into `.git/index` as they are now
* `git reset HEAD *` - unstage all
* `git reset HEAD *.swp` - unstage all `.swp` files
* `git reset HEAD <file>` - unstage from index
* `git reset --hard HEAD^` - reset current branch and working dir to its
state at HEAD^ In addition to losing any changes in the working
directory, it will also remove all later commits from this branch. If
this branch is the only branch containing those commits, they will be
lost. Also, don't use git reset on a publicly-visible branch that other
developers pull from, as it will force needless merges on other
developers to clean up the history. If you need to undo changes that you
have pushed, use git revert instead.
* `git revert`
* `git gc` - garbage collect leftover objects.
* `git grep "hello" v2.5` - search for string "hello" in v2.5 history.
* `git grep "hello"` - search for "hello" in current working dir among
tracked files.
* `git commit -m 'my message'` - create a new snapshot from staged
changes.
* `git commit -v` - open an editor with status and diff attached as
comments.
* `git commit -a -m 'added new benchmarks'` - skip `git add` and add and
commit automatically what's tracked and changed.
* `git commit --amend` - fix the last commit (both contents and message)
* `git status -s` - compare files in working directory and index against
the latest snapshot
* `git checkout` - updates files in the working tree and HEAD, resets
index.
* `git checkout -b <new-head> --track <remote-shorthand>/<head>`
* `git checkout -b [new-head] [remote/head]` - checkout a remote head
into a local tracking branch.
* `git checkout -- <file>` - replace file in the working directory with
one from the latest snapshot (discard changes)
* `git checkout -- .` - discard all unstaged changes.
* `git checkout [commit-hash]` - 'HEAD = commit-hash and revert files in
working directory'
* `git checkout --track remote/head` - checkout a remote head into a
local tracking head.
* `git-check-ref-format`

Now git uses reflog. HEAD@\{1} is the previous version of HEAD, i.e.
@\{1} is $(git symbolic-ref HEAD)@\{1}

`git ls-remote --heads http://git.kernel.org/.../jgarzik/libata-dev.git`
- check the branch names in a remote repo.

[[art-of-merging-and-conflict-resolution]]
Art of merging and conflict resolution
--------------------------------------

In git if anyone move an directory and someone else create a file in
that directory in another branch merging logic won't detect this and the
created file will land in the unexpected place after the merge. That's
why if someone is going to rename or move directories they should notify
other collaborators about that.

[[theory]]
Theory
~~~~~~

With git, every merge is a conflict, which leaves you with an index that
contains three versions of each file, the versions from each branch and
the base. On this index, various resolvers are run, which can decide for
each individual file how to resolve the matter.

The first stage is a trivial resolver, which takes care of things like
unchanged files, cases where one branch has modified a file while the
other didn't, or where both branches contain the same new version of the
file.

Afterwards, it's plugins that look at the remaining cases. There is a
plugin that handles text files by identifying individual changes (like
diff) in one branch and trying to apply those to the other branch,
falling back on placing conflict markers if that doesn't work. You can
easily hook in your own merge tool at this point, for example, you could
write a tool that knows how to merge XML files without violating
well-formedness, or that gives a graphical user interface that allows
interactive editing and a side-by-side view (for example, kdiff3 does
that).

So the presentation of conflicts is really a matter of the plugin used;
the default plugin for text files will use the same style as CVS did,
because people and tools are used to it, and the conflict markers are a
known syntax error in almost any programming language.

`merge-file` is the last-resort merge driver for text files. You can
specify that a different merge driver should be used instead.

By default the commits are shown in reverse chronological order. The
default revision range is HEAD. -
`git log [<options>] [<revision range>] [[\--] <path>…​]` The command
takes options applicable to the `git rev-list` to control what is shown
and how, and options applicable to the `git diff-*` to control how the
changes each commit introduces are shown. - `git log -p` - commits with
diffs (patches) (helpful for code review) - `git log --stat` - commits
with stats - `git log --stat --summary` - `git log --shortstat`,
`--name-only`, `--name-status`, `--abbrev-commit`, `--relative-date` -

Git Branching
-------------

A head is a movable pointer to one of commits. `HEAD` is a movable
pointer to the currently active head. `HEAD^` is a `HEAD`'s parent.
`HEAD~2` - is a `HEAD`'s grandparent. `HEAD^1` - first parent of HEAD
`HEAD^2` - second parent of HEAD - A successful Git branching model

[[stashing]]
Stashing
--------

Stashing takes modified tracked files and staged changes and saves it on
a stack of unfinished changes that you can reapply at any time. -

http://stackoverflow.com/questions/3040833/stash-only-one-file-out-of-multiple-files-that-have-changed-with-git/
- `git stash list` - show stash stack - `git stash apply` - apply the
stack top stash, by default changes that were staged are not staged
again, you continue to have stash in a stack -
`git stash apply stash@{2}` - apply a particular stash -
`git stash apply --index` - try also to stage changes that were staged
during saving a stash - `git stash drop [stash@{2}]` - drop a (named)
stash from the stack - `git stash pop` - apply the topmost stash and
drop it.

Allows for a cleaner history which is important for a code review and
easy pull requests integration. Do not rebase commits that exist outside
your repository. If you treat rebasing as a way to clean up and work
with commits before you push them, and if you only rebase commits that
have never been available publicly, then you’ll be fine. If you rebase
commits that have already been pushed publicly, and people may have
based work on those commits, then you may be in for some frustrating
trouble, and the scorn of your teammates.
* `git checkout topic-branch`
* `git rebase master`
* `git checkout master`
* `git merge topic-branch` Rebasing replays changes from one line of
work onto another in the order they were introduced, whereas merging
takes the endpoints and merges them together.

[[installing-from-source]]
Installing from source
----------------------

If you do want to install Git from source, you need to have the
following libraries that Git depends on: `curl`, `zlib`, `openssl`,
`expat`, and `libiconv`. - https://www.kernel.org/pub/software/scm/git/
- https://github.com/git/git/releases

....
$ tar -zxf git-2.0.0.tar.gz
$ cd git-2.0.0
$ make configure
$ ./configure --prefix=/usr
$ make all doc info
$ sudo make install install-doc install-html install-info
....

After this is done, you can also get Git via Git itself for updates:

Git can use four major protocols to transfer data: Local, HTTP, Secure
Shell (SSH) and Git.
