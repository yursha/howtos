Arch install copies some files into `/usr/sharde/X11`

Scalable fonts with full antialiasing, managed on the client side by
`fontconfig`, and displayed by the `Xft` library using the `RENDER`
extension. The most popular and actively developed graphical toolkits
are `Qt` and `GTK+`. `freedesktop.org` has coordinated shared standards
for desktop menu entries and icons. Modern display hardware is 24-bit
palette-free color wiith 3D capabilities, and hardware acceleration.
Shading, gradients.

[[layers]]
Layers
~~~~~~

* Application clients (Firefox)
* Desktop Environment (Gnome, KDE - panels, desktop icon managers) -
programs which provide desktop paradigm to the user, menus, trays,
panels, icons, applets, etc.
* Window and Compositing Manager (Compiz, Metacity, kwin - placement and
control of windows, window decorations, title bars, borders, controls
for resizing, maximizing, minimizing, moving and closing of windows).
Only one window manager can be active on a display at a time.
* Session Manager (gnome-session, ksmserver) - tracks application state
aacross login sessions, starting standard clients such as the window
manager and desktop environment components, restarting applications that
were active at the end of a previous session, and optionally restarting
applications if they crash.
* Display Manager (gdm, kdm, xdm - local X server startup and user
authentication) (can use biometric scanning for authentication)
* X Window Server - hardware management (keyboard, video screen,
touchpad drivers, pointing devices, video cards, touchscreens, mice)
* Network Transports - (TCP/IP, Unix domain sockets - client/server
connections)
* Toolkits (GTK, Qt, Motif, Xaw) - support and simplify the construction
of the client layers.
