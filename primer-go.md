# Program organization

A program consists of packages. A package has public and private names. Public names start with a capital letter. You have to import a package to use its public symbols in another package.
Package name is the last element of the import path. E.g, the "math/rand" package comprises files that begin with the statement package rand. A program starts in package **main**.
