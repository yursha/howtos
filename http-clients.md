# telnet
- `telnet host port` - test if a given host listens on a given port (better than ping which just checks the host availability)

# wget

# [`iputils`](https://github.com/iputils/iputils) - network monitoring utilities

- `ping` - sends a series of ICMP `ECHO_REQUEST` packets to a specified host to discover whether it is alive and receiving network traffic.
For security purposes (why?) port used by ping is usually disabled on sensitive machines.
