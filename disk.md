# Concepts
- *Disk striping* is the process of dividing a body of data into blocks and spreading the data blocks across multiple storage devices, such as hard disks or solid-state drives (SSDs). A stripe consists of the data divided across the set of hard disks or SSDs, and a striped unit, or strip, that refers to the data slice on an individual drive.
- IOPS (input/output operations per second)

# util-linux
- lsblk - list block devices
