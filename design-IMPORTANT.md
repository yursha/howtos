Data validation depends entirely on the context of the operation youâ€™re trying to perform. Don't try to define *universal* validation because universal truth does not exist.

Data equality depends on the context of comparison. So defining universal `equals` is impossible.

Make it obvious for debugging purposes **where** exactly an error happened and why.
