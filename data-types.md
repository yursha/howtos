# Concepts
- data types define how bit sequences are interpreted
- each programming language provides types (ways) to represent
  + Integers. May be signed or unsigned which affects the represented numeric range and what CPU instructions are generated. May be 1, 2, 4 or 8 bytes.
  + floating point numbers
  + true or false
  + Characters. Usually represented as integers.
  + Strings. Usually represented as arrays of characters, either with a known length or '\0'-terminated.
  + null reference. 
- Some languages allow users to define composite types:
  + classes
  + structs
  + unions
  + enumerations
  + arrays
- Most languages provide libraries with data structures such as:
  + lists
  + hash tables
  + binary search trees
